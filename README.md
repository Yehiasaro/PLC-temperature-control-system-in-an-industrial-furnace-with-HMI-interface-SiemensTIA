Our industrial process boasts a sophisticated temperature control system comprising four thermostats and three heating units. Its primary objective? To uphold a specific temperature range by orchestrating the heaters' operation in response to the thermostats' readings.

Here's the elegant logic governing our process:

1. Thermostat Configuration: We've outfitted the system with four thermostats—TS1, TS2, TS3, and TS4—each calibrated to distinct temperatures: 55°C, 60°C, 65°C, and 70°C, respectively.
  
2. Temperature Modulation:
   - Below 55°C: All three heaters (H1, H2, and H3) kick into action, diligently elevating the temperature to meet the desired range.
   - 55°C to 60°C: Only H2 and H3 remain active, maintaining the temperature within this interval.
   - 60°C to 65°C: Solely H3 remains operational, ensuring precise temperature control.
   - Above 70°C: Should the temperature exceed TS4's threshold, all heaters promptly shut down, safeguarding against overheating. Our safety shutoff relay (CR1) serves as a fail-safe, ensuring no heater remains operational beyond the safe range.

3. Master Switch Control: The entire system can be effortlessly managed via a master switch, granting convenient ON/OFF functionality.

In essence, our temperature control system maintains optimal temperature conditions by intelligently toggling the heating units, promoting energy efficiency and operational safety through meticulous temperature management and fail-safe mechanisms.
